        <h3>FURNACE DETAIL</h3>
        <h4><b>1.HEARTH</b></h4>
        <p>It is a receptacle to collect liquid slag and metal and is also
          refered to as a crucible .
          Made up of <i>CARBON BLOCKS</i>.
          Water cooled copper or steel plates in side walls to protect the lining.
          Tap hole for iron 0.3- 0.6 m above hearth bottom.
          Slag notch 1.2-1.6 m above iron tap hole.Closed with clay when not in use.
          At top level of hearth are tuyeres located uniformly.
        </p>
        <h4><b>2.BOSH</b></h4>
        <p>
          Top of the bosh has maximum diameter and is zone of intense heat.
          It is stadium type construction with steel reinforcement.
          water cooled copper plates inserted at regular intervals at furnace
          lining , to protect against high temperature.The intensive cooling
          of thin walled bosh forms a layer of solidified slag mixed graphite on
          the lining which in reality protect the inner surfaxe of lining.
        </p>
        <h4><b>3.STACK</b></h4>
        <p>
          Stack is welded steel plate construction lined from inside to a thickness
          of about a meter of hard fiberbricks.Flat water cooled
          plates are inserted in the bottom most part of stack lining.
          Top 2-3 m is protected from abrasion caused by falling charge
          by providing armour plates on inner surface of lining.
        </p>
        <h4><b>4.TUYERE AND BUSTLE PIPE</b></h4>
        <p>Located immediately above the hearth.
          Hot air blown for fuel combustion.Air from hot blast stove is blown to
          s huge circulat pipe called bustle pipe. This equialises pressure of blast
          at all tuyere.
        </p>
        <h4><b>5. BELL AND HOPPER</b></h4>
        <p>This system was used for charging the solid charge.It allowed smooth charging
          without off gas leaking out into open.
          A modifies bell-less charging with distributing <i>chute</i> known as
          Paul Wurtz Distributor(BLPWD) replaced traditional double bell.
          This improved burden distribution inside the furnace and thereby improved
          efficiency.
          Still better modification , known as Gimble Top, developed by
          Siemens Voest Alpine group.
          <i>C-furnace of Tata Steel adopted it during 2007-2008
          </i>
        </p>
        <h4><b>6.OFF-TAKE</b></h4>
        <p>
          Four exhaust pipes , connected to furnace top evenly at four points
          .These rise vertically up and join to a bigger single pipe known as
          <i>downcomer</i>,which deliver the gas to gas cleaning system,i.e dust
          catcher
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sub_div" id="bottom_div">
        <h3>HOT BLAST STOVE</h3>
        <p>Air blast preheated to temperature of 700-1300`C
          Set of 3-4 regenerators is provided for each furnace.During working
          one stove is <i>on blast</i> while other are <i>on gas</i>,i.e getting
          heated by burning the clean blast furnace gas.

        </p>
        <h3>GAS CLEANING</h3>
        <p>
          The blast furnace gas is cleaned before being used.The downcomer opens
          up in dust catcher.Here coarse particles settle down.Coarse cleaned gas
          is passed through wet or dry scrubbers and electrostatic
          precipitators.25% gas is used in stove for production of hot preheated
          blast, 75% gas used elswhere
        </p>

        <h3>RAW MATERIAL STORAGE AND HANDLING</h3>
        <p>
          To produce one tonne of pig iron , two to three ton of raw materials
          are required to be charged. A large stock of these raw materials is
          required to be readily available.
        </p>
        <h3>LIQUID PRODUCTS DISPOSAL</h3>
        <p>
          Three different products, gas , slag and liquid metal are generated
          A sufficient large ,raised platform is provided in front of the
          furnace at a level just below the metal tap hole. Firebrick channels
          are constructed in platform to allow liqhuid metal and slag
          seperately to flow into respective ladels,mmoving on rails.A
          skimmer arrangement seperates slag from metal and diverts it to Slag
          side. This is calles <i>cast-house</i>
          Slag and metal both separated. Slag sent to cement plant
        </p>
        <h4>LADDLE TYPES</h4>
        <p>Two type of hot metal laddle for transfering hot metal to steel plant
          <br> <br>
          1.Open-top laddle : <br>
          It is open from top,heat loss to atmosphere . The open top
          laddle is far better for operations such as S or Si or even p
          removal
          <br><br>
          2.Torpedo ladle :<br>
          This is shaped like torpedo where surface area of
          hot metal exposed to surface is very small
          , to conserve heat loss During transfering .
        </p>

        <h3>BLAST FURNACE OPERATION AND CONTROL</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> COKE,LIMESTONE AND ORE ARE NEVER PREMIXED </li>
          <li>THESE ARE CHARGED SEPERATELY ONE SKIPFUL AT A TIME</li>
          <li>BF OPERATION CONTROLLED FROM TOP BY TRYING TO DISTRIBUTE
            SOKID CHARGE MORE UNIFORMLY</li>
          <li>CONTROLED FROM BOTTOM BY CONTROLING TEMPERATURE AND TUYERE RATE
            OF BLAST</li>
        </ol>
